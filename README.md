# Quicksort

Application of Quicksort Algorithm

The following techniques are claimed to improve the performance over the basic Quick Sort algorithm: 
a) Randomize pivot element 
b) Median-of-three partition 
c) Directly using Insertion Sort when a partition is small (say < 10 elements) 
d) Technique a) plus Technique c) 
e) Technique b) plus Technique c) 

Objective:
Implement the basic Quick Sort algorithm and the above improvements. 
Run experiments to determine the percentages of key comparisons saved in each case over the basic Quick Sort algorithm, using randomly generated integer arrays of size 100,000 as inputs.
